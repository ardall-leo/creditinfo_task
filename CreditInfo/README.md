# XML Loading + XSD Validation + Extended bussiness rule
This project can load XML data and validate with the XSD. The extended bussiness rule validation is added to the serialized model using fluent validation.

## How to Run
It's just simple console log program, just click run. The things that should be there, but not there yet is to integrate the XSD validation and Extended validation. Probably I can raise event and associate to the correct one, but still struggling to figure that out.
